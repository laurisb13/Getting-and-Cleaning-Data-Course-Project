# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository includes the codes for the Data Science's course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files in the repository:

- run_analysis.R is code to perform the analysis. It can be launched in RStudio by importing the file.
- CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that was carried out to clean up the data.
